##  INTRODUCTION
Hello Everyone!
I developed this application to extend knowlege of graph algorithms from University course work.
You can explore different types of pathfinding algorithms included in this repositery with the provided step by step installment method.
I hope you whoever playing around my project enjoy the time!
Thank you!

##  WHAT IS IN THIS PROJECT
###   Features
    -Wall
    Walls can be created by dragging mouse. While pathfinding algorithm searches for paths, such walls are
    ignored as it is considered as "obstacle".
    
    -Algorithms
