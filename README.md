##      INTRODUCTION
Hello Everyone!
I developed this application to extend knowlege of graph algorithms from University course work.
You can explore different types of pathfinding algorithms included in this repositery with the provided step by step installment method.
I hope you whoever playing around my project enjoy the time!
Thank you!

##      HOW TO PLAY WITH IT?
To play around with the project, you will need the following or higher version of tools.
###     Version explanation

##      WHAT IS IN THIS PROJECT
###     Features
1. Wall

Walls can be created by dragging mouse. While pathfinding algorithm searches for paths, such walls are
ignored as it is considered as "obstacle".
Both the start and end Nodes(highlighted as blue and red color) can be moved for your choice as well.
